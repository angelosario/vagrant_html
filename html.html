		<span>Unified Workflow</span>
		<h2>Simple and Powerful</h2>
		<p>Vagrant provides the same, easy workflow regardless of your role as a developer, operator, or designer. It leverages a declarative configuration file which describes all your software requirements, packages, operating system configuration, users, and more.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
		<span>Enforce Consistency</span>
		<h2>Production Parity</h2>
		<p>The cost of fixing a bug exponentially increases the closer it gets to production. Vagrant aims to mirror production environments by providing the same operating system, packages, users, and configurations, all while giving users the flexibility to use their favorite editor, IDE, and browser. Vagrant also integrates with your existing configuration management tooling like Chef, Puppet, Ansible, or Salt, so you can use the same scripts to configure Vagrant as production.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
		<span>Cross-Platform</span>
		<h2>Works where you work</h2>
		<p>Vagrant works on Mac, Linux, Windows, and more. Remote development environments force users to give up their favorite editors and programs. Vagrant works on your local system with the tools you're already familiar with. Easily code in your favorite text editor, edit images in your favorite manipulation program, and debug using your favorite tools, all from the comfort of your local laptop.</p>

		<span>Trusted at Scale</span>
		<h2>Trusted by</h2>
		<p>Vagrant is trusted by thousands of developers, operators, and designers everyday. Here are just a few of the organizations that choose Vagrant to automate their development environments, in lightweight and reproducible ways.</p>
